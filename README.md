# What is this?
The public-facing bug tracker for Red Sun Loadout (and for other bugs in gamemodes et cetera.)

# How do I submit bugs?
Click the "Issues" tab above and click the green button.

# Why are we using this and not the forums?
Better notifications, tagging issues, assigning developers to bugs, easier to keep track of, and an overall more sophisticated system than just using a forum board (which nobody really used in the first place)
