# What is this?
`LoadoutBugTracker` is the public-facing bug tracker for Red Sun Over Paradise's plugins, [forum](https://forum.redsun.tf) and [main website, the Red Sun Loadout](https://redsun.tf).

# How do I submit bugs?
Click the "Issues" tab above and click the green button. Be sure to describe clearly what the bug is and what you have possibly done to trigger said bug. Trying to include the following stuff will make your submitted issue easier to be fixed:
* **If it happened inside our server(s)**, map and server where the bug happened on.
* Steps to recreate the bug, if applicable.
* Any errors printed from the platform (In-game console, web page, etc.)

# Why are we using GitHub and not the forums?
It gives us access to better notifications, ability to tag issues, assigning specific developers to bugs based on their speciality and an overall more sophisticated system than just using a forum board that is not used as much in the first place.
